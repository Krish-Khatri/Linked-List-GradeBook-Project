# Linked-List-GradeBook-Project
This is a simple c program that creates a grade book from a dat file and stores it as a linked list
The grade book is
just a linked list of students enrolled, and there is a linked list of grades for each student.

Each student has a name (with both lastName and firstName) and a linked list of grades headed by
headGradeList. Each grade contains a grade name (name) and a numeric value (value) for the actual grade.
